Sure! Here's a polished self-introduction in fluent English. I can also tailor it for professional, casual, or academic contexts if you want. Here's a general version:

5. Closing (20–30 seconds):

✅ This structure naturally fills around 3 minutes if you speak at a comfortable pace.
✅ Tip: Practice it aloud a few times to make it sound conversational, not memorized.

If you want, I can write a fully ready-to-speak 3-minute script tailored with smooth transitions and examples so you can deliver it naturally without memorizing bullet points. Do you want me to do that?––––-
